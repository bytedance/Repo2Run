## üöÄ News
Our paper: "Repo2Run: Automated Building Executable Environment for Code Repository at Scale" has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2025** main track as a **spotlight**!

An LLM-based build agent system that helps manage and automate build processes in containerized environments. This project provides tools for handling dependencies, resolving conflicts, and managing build configurations.

## Features

- Docker-based sandbox environment for isolated builds
- Automated dependency management and conflict resolution
- Support for Python version management
- Waiting list and conflict list management for package dependencies
- Error format handling and output collection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/repo2run.git
cd repo2run
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main entry point is through the build agent's main script. You can run it with the following arguments:

```bash
python build_agent/main.py <repository_full_name> <sha> <root_path>
```

Where:
- `repository_full_name`: The full name of the repository (e.g., user/repo)
- `sha`: The commit SHA
- `root_path`: The root path for the build process

## Note
üí° For example, you can use the following repository‚Äîwhich is relatively easy to set up‚Äîto verify whether there are any issues with running it. I have already confirmed that it can be successfully configured on several mainstream models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

```
python main.py "Benexl/FastAnime" "677f4690fab4651163d0330786672cf1ba1351bf" .
```

You can use this relatively easy-to-configure repository as a baseline to evaluate whether your chosen model can effectively handle this type of task. If the entire program starts successfully, the corresponding repository contents will be saved under `utils/repo`, and an `output` folder will be created with a structure like the following:
- `inner_commands.json`
- `output_commands.json`
- `pip_list.json`
- `pipdeptree.json`
- `pipdeptree.txt`
- `sha.txt`
- `test.txt`
- `track.json`
- `track.txt`

Please note: if the `output` folder does not contain trajectory files such as `track.json`, it indicates that there was an issue during execution. You can first check it yourself; if other problems arise, feel free to open a GitHub Issue.

## Project Structure

- `build_agent/` - Main package directory
  - `agents/` - Agent implementations for build configuration
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helper classes
  - `docker/` - Docker-related configurations
  - `main.py` - Main entry point
  - `multi_main.py` - Multi-process support

## Features in Detail

### Sandbox Environment
The project uses Docker containers to create isolated build environments, ensuring clean and reproducible builds.

### Dependency Management
- **Waiting List**: Manages package installation queue
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles version conflicts between packages
- **Error Handling**: Formats and processes build errors

### Configuration Agent
Utilizes GPT models to assist in build configuration and problem resolution.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Q&A
We‚Äôve collected some common issues for your reference. If you encounter something that isn‚Äôt covered or resolved, feel free to open an Issue.

### 1. - The program won‚Äôt start, or you can‚Äôt proceed to the next step after downloading the repository
A: I recommend first running our suggested example to verify that your workflow can run end to end. If files like `track.json` are not generated in your `output` folder, it‚Äôs usually an environment configuration issue. Check whether Docker has started correctly.
### 2. The program runs, but the model keeps throwing errors like: ‚ÄúERROR! Your reply does not contain valid block or final answer‚Äù
A: This error originates from `agents/configuration.py`, which checks whether the LLM‚Äôs reply contains a command structure wrapped in triple backticks ```. In practice, we‚Äôve clearly specified the required output format in the prompt; at least in our tests, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet did not exhibit this issue. If you encounter it, we suggest first inspecting the LLM‚Äôs raw output (e.g., `track.json` or `track.txt`).
